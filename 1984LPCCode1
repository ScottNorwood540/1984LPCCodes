Everybody in Canada has an opinion on the man; some praise him for being the visionary leader who has brought Canada into a new era, one formed in his image. Others deride him as an arrogant egotist who has consistently put the interests of himself and his party over those of the Canadian people. One thing is certain; the man has indelibly left his mark in this country.<br> <br> From official bilingualism to the October Crisis, from judicial liberalization to the NEP, from the Quebec Independence referendum to the patriation of the constitution. Many of the immense changes in this country have been crafted by PET, and now, after 16 years in power, the country is left teetering at the precipice of its most immense change yet: Who will replace the resigning Pierre Elliot Trudeau to take up the mantle of Prime Minister of Canada and leader of the “Natural Governing Party”? <br> <br> Amid the Prime Minister’s sudden resignation and with an election on the horizon, the unthinkable has begun to happen, the Liberals are coming back from the dead in the polls, and two familiar faces emerge as the frontrunners to take the party into the next election.</p></div>",

His accomplishments as Minister of Justice have been burned into the brains of every Canadian; he successfully won the referendum for the country, successfully patriated the constitution and led the charge in creating the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<br><br> So what's the problem here? Why isn't Chrétien the frontrunner? <br><br> It's simple: he rubs the establishment the wrong way. The Liberal has thrown their support towards Turner. Despite this, Chrétien refuses to give up and is hellbent on becoming the next Prime Minister. <br><br> In order to lead the Liberal Party, Jean Chrétien must navigate a large disadvantage in campaign funding, the establishment's unwavering support of John Turner and his perception of only appealing to French Canadians.  <br><br> However, Chrétien is an electric campaigner, able to go for months on end without any signs of slowing down. If there is anybody on the planet capable of making this comeback, it's him. He believes that he is the true people's champion, and he'll be damned if that doesn't translate to results.",
